Description:
This project is a two-factor authentication (2FA) system that provides an additional layer of security for user authentication. 
It allows users to log in with their username and password and then verify their identity using a one-time password (OTP) generated by their authenticator app.

Key Features:

Username and Password Authentication: Allow users to log in with their username and password.
OTP Generation: Generate a one-time password (OTP) using an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator).
OTP Verification: Verify the user's identity by matching the OTP generated by the authenticator app.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Provide an additional layer of security by requiring both username/password and OTP for authentication.
User Management: Manage user accounts, including registration, login, and account recovery.
How to Use:

Open the login page in a web browser.
Enter your username and password.
Open your authenticator app and generate a one-time password (OTP).
Enter the OTP into the login page and click the "Verify" button.
If the OTP is correct, you will be logged in successfully. Otherwise, you will need to try again.
